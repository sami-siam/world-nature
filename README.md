      <h2>View over islands in Møre og Romsdal, Norway:</h2>
      
      <img src="images/norway.jpg" alt="">
      
      <p>Spanning fjord-notched coastlines, forested archipelagos and cloud-catching peaks, Møre og Romsdal is like a greatest-hits collection of Norwegian splendour. It's in a part of the country known as Western Norway, bounded by the Atlantic Ocean. And this county wears its Viking heritage proudly: Møre og Romsdal's coat of arms displays a trio of gilded Viking ships against a background of blue sea. Indeed, privately-owned boats and commuter ferries are still an important means of transport in this area, as it's seemingly made up of as much water as land. In the 1990s slender cantilever bridges were added to help people get around the jigsaw coastline.

      <h2>how sea caves formed ?..</h2>
      
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="images/caves.jpg"></div>
      
      <p>Sea caves, also known as littoral caves, are found along coasts all over the world. They are formed primarily by the erosion of rock from wind and waves that attack weak spots in cliffs lining the shores of oceans and lakes. The sea cave on our homepage was photographed on the Isle of Skye. The scenic island in the Inner Hebrides is renowned for its natural beauty and home to some of Scotland's most dramatic landscapes.
